# Calculator
The objective of this app was to create a simple calculator that allows the user to add, subtract, multiply or divide two numbers. 
Thereâ€™s output is displayed and the the user has the option to continue the app or exit.
Ultimately, the learning objective of this project was to get familiar with object orientated programming in python.
I was able to create a calculator class and initialise it with the two input numbers. Each of the 4 arithmetic operations are represented by methods that stores an instant variable 
which is then retrieved in the decision making method.
